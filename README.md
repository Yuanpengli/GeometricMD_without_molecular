The code is used to solving the following differential equation.
\begin{equation}
\dot{x}=k(x)+\sqrt{2* \epsilon} g(x) \eta_t
\end{equation}
which is related to the attractor:
\begin{equation}
A[X()]=1/4 \int_0^1 <\dot{x}-k(x),\dot{x}-k(x)>_{Q^{-1}} dt
\end{equation}

Hence, solving the functional problem is our purpose.
